===================

Some custom MATLAB functions that I've written. Some of these are available
using some of the various toolboxes, but that doesn't mean much if they
aren't available.

Comments in these vary, but the more complicated ones are well commented.
Those which are more trivial should be self-evident.

What do these do?
-----------------
* pca.m - Principle Component Analysis using Eigenvector Decomposition
* pca\_recon.m - Reconstructs data that has been PCA'd.
* snr.m - Calculates the Signal to Noise Ratio between two sets of data.
* mse.m - Calculates the Mean Square Error between two sets of data.
